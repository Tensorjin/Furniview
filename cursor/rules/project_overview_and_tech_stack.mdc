# Project Overview

Furniview is a platform designed to revolutionize the furniture assembly process by providing interactive 3D assembly instructions. It aims to replace traditional paper manuals with an intuitive, user-friendly digital experience. The platform will serve both furniture companies, allowing them to upload and manage 3D models of their products, and end customers, who will use the interactive instructions for assembly.

Key Goals:
- Simplify furniture assembly for end customers.
- Reduce frustration and errors associated with traditional manuals.
- Help furniture companies decrease support calls and product returns related to assembly difficulties.
- Enhance overall customer satisfaction and brand perception for furniture companies.
