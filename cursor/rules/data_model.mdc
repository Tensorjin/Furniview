# Data Model (Supabase)

This document will outline the database schema for the Furniview project, implemented in Supabase (PostgreSQL).

Key Entities (to be detailed):
- Users (for both customers and company representatives)
- Furniture Companies
- Furniture Models (including 3D model references, assembly steps, metadata)
- User Profiles
- Potentially: Usage analytics, feedback/ratings for instructions.

We will define:
- Tables and their columns (with data types and constraints)
- Relationships between tables (foreign keys)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control.

*This section will be populated as we design and implement the Supabase database schema.*
